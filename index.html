I am a Quartz fellow at the OU in Milton Keynes, UK. My  research focus on quantum-like adaptive multimodal information retrieval systems. My  main research interests lie in statistics, data mining, predictive analytics, machine learning, deep reinforcement learning, pattern recognition, speech and image recognition, recommendation systems, accuracy improvement, information extraction, information retrieval, natural language processing (NLP), and data visualization. Some other research interests fall under cognitive science and game-based learning.

I hold a B.Sc. in informatics engineering from the Technological Educational Institute of Crete and a M.Sc. in Informatics, with a specialization in Information and Communication Technologies from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. Before joining Quartz, I had worked as a data scientist for another EU Marie Curie ITN project named Eduworks. I have also worked in many IT projects for more than 10 years of continuous services developing bespoke information systems to improve operational efficiency and business processes.
